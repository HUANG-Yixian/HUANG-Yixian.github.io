  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Learning Disabilities and Behavioral Disorders(LD/BD) at the University of Texas at Austin. I am a quantitative researcher, and am interested in randomized controlled trial (RCT) and meta-analysis research.
  <h3> Research Interests</h3>
  <p>My research interests center around language and literacy development in children, with attention to English learners and students with special needs. Specifically, I am focusing on developing evidence-based interventions and assessments for children with dyslexia and/or dyscalculia.</p>
  <p>**I am currently looking for research opportunities broadly related to language development and cognitive neuroscience.**</p>
